# Card Wars!
This was a summer project done in the summer of 2016. It is based on Advance Wars, a often forgotten GBA series based on tactical gameplay. I enjoyed the series as a kid and wanted to develop my own weaker iteration :-).

## Small Disclaimer
The game is far from completion (completion being the way I would like the game to be played out), but primary features i.e. graphics, sound, controls, etc. are all there. A little more functionality is needed as well as more content. I plan on completing it in the near future when I have some free time.

## How To Play
Since the game does not have much content, this section will be small :-).
* WASD/Arrow Keys to navigate the main menu/map
* Spacebar is the 'select' button i.e. select a button on the main menu
* Click the deck to draw a card
* Click the card and an appropriate tile to place it
* Click the end turn button to allow the AI to take a turn
* Click your placed units to have them perform an action once per turn

## Requirements
To run just the JAR file:

JRE 8 or above

To download the code and compile it yourself:

JDK 8 or above

## Installation
You can use the code above to compile it on your own machine, or download the JAR file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0pc8oyj9pqs79ui/Card%20Wars.jar?dl=0). Once downloaded, simply run it.
